// The 'catch' statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.

// Syntax:-

// let a = 10;
try {
    console.log(a);// If this is correct then it will execute.
} catch {
    console.log("variable a doesn't exists");// If not then this block will ececute.
}
